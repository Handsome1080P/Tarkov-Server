The rifle was introduced in 2011 at the international exhibition of Russian weapons in Nizhny Tagil, and is entirely original, using no third-party components. The rifle ensures maximum comfort of the user while aiming and shooting, featuring a quick sighting line recovery, high reliability and ergonomics. The stainless steel barrel has a thread for installing a muzzle brake-compensator or a sound suppressor. The equipped muzzle brake-compensator effectively reduces impulse and allows the most comfortable recoil handling.",

It's a variant of the M1911, and has been the standard-issue side arm for the Force Recon Element of the United States Marine Corps' Marine Expeditionary Units since 1985.\n\nThe improved M45A1 features several changes to the original M1911A1 design. One feature is the dual recoil spring system that spreads out the recoil force of the .45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse. It also has 3-dot tritium night sights, a 5-inch national match barrel, ambidextrous safety, a picatinny rail, and a desert tan Cerakote finish.",
